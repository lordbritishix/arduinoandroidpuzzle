====================

Our entry to the GDG Vancouver 2014 Hackathon: Android Puzzle game controlled by Arduino (Won 2nd Place!)

Warning: Code condition is Hackathon quality (i.e. it's a mess)

The 3 components of this project are:
1. ArduinoServer - Simple socket server, using Java
2. AndroidPuzzle - Puzzle game app, running in Android
3. Arduino - Code running on the Arduino board

Here's the video about our hack:
